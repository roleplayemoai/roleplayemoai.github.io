        <p><b>Tech workers voice concerns over invasive monitoring system that scans facial expressions and emotions during work hours and meetings.</b></p>
        <p>Employees at Leading IT Company have expressed serious privacy and ethical concerns after internal documents revealed plans to implement an emotion-scanning AI system to monitor workers during their daily activities and meetings.</p>
        <p>The controversial technology, which would analyze facial expressions, voice patterns, and other biometric data to evaluate "mental well-being" and job performance, was detailed in communications between the company and EmoAI, a provider of emotion recognition software.</p>
        <p>"This crosses a fundamental line between professional oversight and invasive surveillance," said one senior developer who requested anonymity. "Many of us feel this technology could create a hostile work environment where we're constantly anxious about being judged not just on our work output, but on our facial expressions during meetings."</p>
        <p>Company leadership has yet to respond to the growing employee concerns, which include questions about data security, algorithmic bias, and the scientific validity of emotion recognition technology itself.</p>
